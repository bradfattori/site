        <h3>Security Assessments</h3>
        <p>It's important to understand that Scoutmon isn't a replacement for a professional penetration test if you can afford one. Our goal is to help uplift your security, but there are limitations. We are not liable for any security risks missed due to the tools, time constraints, and scope of our assessments.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity is crucial, but many smaller businesses find the necessary technical skills and tools to be cost-prohibitive. Scoutmon Technologies offers a lower-cost security assessment to help identify security risks from an external perspective. While established companies should always conduct external penetration testing if the budget allows, the high costs—ranging from thousands to tens of thousands—aren't always feasible for smaller businesses.</p>
        <p>Scoutmon Technologies performs external security assessments using free or lower-cost tools compared to other established penetration testing companies. Due to the reduced cost, this work is often conducted outside of regular business hours and on weekends, alongside our primary jobs. This means the security assessment is performed with limited time and tools, which may offer restricted functionality.</p>
        <p>While our methodology is similar to a professional penetration test, these constraints mean there is a risk of not discovering all vulnerabilities. We focus on identifying low-hanging fruit, performing automated tests, and highlighting areas that clients can mitigate to improve their security. This service should not replace professional penetration testing, especially when compliance with standards like ISO 27001 or PCI DSS is required.</p>
